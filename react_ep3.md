Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 1 🚀  Laying the Foundation!   (Namaste-React)  💡 Please make sure to follow along with the whole  ”Namaste   React"  series, starting from Episode-1 and continuing   through each subsequent episode. The notes are designed   to provide detailed explanations of each concept along   with examples to ensure thorough understanding. Each   episode builds upon the knowledge gained from the   previous ones, so starting from the beginning will give   you a comprehensive understanding of React development.  💡 I've got a quick tip for you. To get the most out of   these notes, it's a good idea to watch  Episode-2  first.   Understanding what  ”Akshay”   shares in the video will make   these notes way easier to understand. 

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 2 So far, here's what we've learned in the previous   episode   We learned that npm is anything but not node   package manager and what is npx. We included node-modules and React in our   project. We got to know the difference between   package.json and package-lock.json. We also explored the concept of bundlers. We learned how to start our app. Don’t forget “Parcel is a Beast”.    Part-1     Q ) What is another way of starting the build of the project?  We will be creating scripts instead of using “ npx parcel   index.html”.  We can create different scripts for starting our   project in Development and Production. In    package.json   ,  in the script section write the following   command.

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 3 To run these scripts, enter the following commands in the   terminal,    To start:  npm run start      or  npm start     For Production Build:  npm run build  💡 If you’re not sure how to start the project in a new   company then find these scripts in    package.json     and use   them.

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 4   Part-2     Revision of previous Episodes    Part-3    Introducing JSX.  Before we begin, we have to remove the existing React Code from   App.js     where we used  React.createElement()  for displaying content   on the webpage but its syntax is very bad. It’s not developer- friendly, and very hard to read. To solve this problem Facebook   developers built JSX. JSX makes developer life easy as we no longer have to write our   code using  React.createElement()  📢 NOTE: We write code for both Machines and Humans but   first for Human understanding as it is read by a lot of   developers  Q ) What is JSX?  JSX is HTML-like or XML-like syntax. JSX stands for JavaScript   XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript.

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 5 It is not a part of React. React apps can be built even   without JSX but the code will become very hard to read. It is not HTML inside JavaScript. JavaScript engine cannot understand JSX as it only   understands ECMAScript  When we log  heading  and  jsxHeading , it gives the same object. From this point, we will not be using  React.createElement()  Introducing Babel

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 6 Q ) Is JSX a valid JavaScript?  The answer is yes and no. JSX is not a valid Javascript syntax as it’s not pure HTML or   pure JavaScript for a browser to understand. JS does not have   built-in JSX. The JS engine does not understand JSX because   the JS engine understands ECMAScript or ES6+ code  Q ) If the browser can’t understand JSX how is it still working?  This is because of Parcel because “ Parcel is a Beast”.  Before the code gets to JS Engine it is sent to Parcel and  Transpiled  there. Then after transpilation, the browser gets the   code that it can understand. Transpilation  ⇒   Converting the code in such a format that the   browsers can understand.  Parcel is like a manager who gives the responsibility of   transpilation to a package called  Babel . Babel is a package that is a compiler/transpiler of JavaScript   that is already present inside ‘ node-modules ’ . It takes JSX and   converts it into the code that browsers understand, as soon as   we write it and save the file. It is not created by Facebook.   Learn more about Babel on  babeljs.io JSX (transpiled by Babel)  ⇒  React.createElement  ⇒  ReactElement    ⇒  JS Object  ⇒  HTML Element(render)  Q ) What is the difference between HTML and JSX?  JSX is not HTML. It’s HTML-like syntax.

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 7 HTML uses ‘class’ property whereas JSX uses ‘className’   property HTML can use hypens in property names whereas JSX uses   camelCase syntax.   Single Line and Multi Line JSX Code  Single line code:  const  jsxHeading  =   < h1 > Namaste React < / h1 >  Multi-line code: If writing JSX in multiple lines then using ‘()’ parenthesis is   mandatory. To tell Babel from where JSX is starting and ending.  const  jsxHeading  =   (    < div >     < h1 > Namaste React < / h1 >    < / div > )  📢 NOTE:  1) Use “Prettier - Code Formatter” VS Code Extension to   make your code look beautiful with proper formatting 2) Use “ES lint” VS Code Extension for linting 3) Use “Better Comments” VS Code Extension to beautify   your comments

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 8 Code all of these things discussed until now for better   understanding.    Part-4    Introducing React Components  Everything inside React is a component.  Q ) What are Components?  There are 2 types of components:  1.Class-based Components -  Old way of writing code, used rarely   in industry  2.Functional Components -  New way of writing code, most commonly   used  Q ) What is a React Functional Components?  It is just a JavaScript Function that returns some JSX or a   react element. Always name React Functional Component with Capital Letters   otherwise you will confuse it with normal function  // All are the same for single-line code const   HeadingComponent1   =   ( )   =>   (    < h1 > Namaste < / h1 > )

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 9 const   HeadingComponent2   =   ( )   =>   {   return   < h1 > Namaste < / h1 > } const   HeadingComponent3   =   ( )   =>   < h1 > Namaste < / h1 >  To render a functional component we call them ‘ <Heading1 /> ’.   This is the syntax that Babel understands.  You can also call them using these ways, ‘ <Title></Title> ’  or ‘{ Title() }’  Components Composition  A component inside a component. Calling a component inside another component is Component   Composition.   const   Title   =   ( )   =>   < h1 > Namaste React < / h1 > const   HeadingComponent   =   ( )   =>   (   < div id = "container" >    < Title  / >   < / div > )  Code inside the ‘Title’ component will be used inside the   ‘HeadingComponent’ component as the ‘Title’ component is called   inside it. It will become something like this,

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 10 const   HeadingComponent   =   ( )   =>   (   < div id = "container" >     < h1 > Namaste React < / h1 >   < / div > )    Part-5      Q ) How to use JavaScript code inside JSX?  Inside a React Component when ‘{}’ parenthesis is present we can   write any JavaScript expression inside it.  const  number  =   10000 ; const   HeadingComponent   =   ( )   =>   (   < div id = "containter" >     { number }     < h1 > Namaste React < / h1 >   < / div > )  Q ) How to call React Element in JSX?  We can use ‘{}’ parenthesis.  const  elem  =   < span >  React Element  < / span > const   HeadingComponent   =   ( )   =>   (   < div id = "containter" >

Laying the Foundation! Namaste-React) 11     { elem }     < h1 > This is Namaste React < / h1 >   < / div > )  Q ) What will happen if we call 2 elements inside each other?  If we put 2 components inside each other, then it will go into   an infinite loop and the stack will overflow. It will freeze   your browser, so it’s not recommended to do so.  Advantages of using JSX.  1) Sanitizes the data If someone gets access to your JS code and sends some malicious   data which will then get displayed on the screen, that attack is   called cross-site scripting.  It can read cookies, local storage, session storage, get   cookies, get info about your device, and read data. JSx takes   care of your data. If some API passes some malicious data JSX will escape it. It   prevents cross-site scripting and sanitizes the data before   rendering 2) Makes code readable JSX makes it easier to write code as we are no longer creating   elements using React.createElement() 3) Makes code simple and elegant 4) Show more useful errors and warnings 5) JSX prevents code injections (attacks)
